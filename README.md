### Hello, I'm Edu 👋

I always loved technology, since I was 8 years old I remember making programs, scripts, and other cool tech stuff. I first made my blog at that age - it doesn't exist anymore. I went to a technical high school and made several projects, including games, websites, systems, and apps. Some of them, still in my GitHub. 

My motto is to find solutions for society's problems using the best technology available.

The code itself isn't the end, is the **tool**.

I work as a full-stack developer, getting my hands dirty with all stack, architecture, cloud solutions, hybrid solutions, mobile or web applications using the most recent frameworks or languages.

I also worked making recommendations systems using machine learning, APIs, cleaning and data mining, deploying, scaling, and maintaining services online.
