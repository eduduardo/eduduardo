### Hello, I'm Edu 👋

🚀 Mobile Specialist in React Native

🔹 8 years of experience in the technology field, with a focus on mobile and web development using JavaScript/TypeScript.

💼 Led projects of various sizes, covering a wide range of technologies. My journey includes development with BLE (Bluetooth Low-Energy), map integration, in-app purchases, SDK integration, Firebase, push notifications, internationalization, animations, unit and end-to-end testing, CD/CI pipeline construction, WebRTC-based video conferencing, real-time chat with websockets. I also have experience in native Swift/Java, enabling the development of any type of mobile application. I've always been involved in end-to-end development, from app conception to publication on app stores. I also hold a Google Play Store certification.

🌐 My skills extend beyond mobile development. I have solid backend knowledge, having worked as a Full Stack developer with proficiency in PHP, Python, SQL, and MongoDB.

☁️ I am AWS certified and have knowledge of AWS infrastructure, allowing me to implement, scale, and maintain online services.

🎨 I have a passion for user interface design and user experience (UI/UX). I always work closely with design teams to implement the best possible user experience.

💡 I've been drawn to technology since the age of 8. I believe that technology is a powerful tool to solve problems and make a positive impact on society. To me, code is just a means to achieve a goal, not the final objective.

🔬 Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in AI integrated with mobile devices and continue to conduct experiments and performance optimizations.
