### Hello, I'm Edu 👋

I always loved techology, since I was 8 years old I remember making programs, scripts, and cool tech stuff. I first made my blog at that age - it doesn't exist anymore. I went to a tecnhical high school and made several projects, incluing games, websites, systems and apps. Some of them, still in my github. 

My motto is to find solutions for society problems using the best techology avaliable.

The code itself isn't the end, is the **tool**.

I work as a full stack developer, getting my hands dirty with all stack, architecture, cloud solutions, hibrid solutions, mobile or web aplications using the most recent frameworks or languages.

I also worked making recommendations systems using machine learning, APIs, cleaning and data mining, deploying, scaling and maintaining services online.
