### Hello, I'm Edu 👋

I am a mobile developer with 6 years of experience and my focus is on React Native, using JavaScript/TypeScript to create high-quality and performant mobile apps. However, I also have extensive experience in full stack development using various technologies such as PHP, Python, SQL, and MongoDB. Additionally, I am passionate about user interface and user experience design (UI/UX) and have had the opportunity to lead small teams on technology projects.

I have also worked with native code in Swift/Java and have experience with infrastructure on AWS, which has allowed me to successfully implement, scale, and maintain online services. I also have knowledge in machine learning and have worked on many different projects at startups, where I had the chance to collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to create innovative solutions.

I have always been drawn to technology and have been learning and building projects since I was 8 years old. My blog may no longer exist, but my love for creating games, websites, systems, and apps has only grown.

I believe that technology is a powerful tool for solving problems and making a positive impact on society. For me, the code is just a means to an end, not the end itself.
