### Hello, I'm Edu 👋

I work as a full-stack developer, no matter what type of technology I get my hands dirty with all stack. I have experience in developing mobile apps using React Native, but also developing APIs and services using the most recent frameworks or languages (such as PHP, JavaScript, Python, SQL, MongoDB, and several others).

I also worked on making recommendations systems using machine learning, cleaning and data mining, deploying, scaling, and maintaining services online on Amazon Web Services.

I always loved technology, since I was 8 years old I remember making programs, scripts, and other cool tech stuff. I first made my blog at that age - it doesn't exist anymore. I went to a technical high school and from that, I never stopped learning! I made several projects, including games, websites, systems, and apps.

My motto is to find solutions for society's problems using the best technology available. The code itself isn't the end, is the **tool**!
